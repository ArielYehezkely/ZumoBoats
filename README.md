# Zumo Boats Workshop

Use this code example to learn about your boat components and how to use them with Arduino code.

Please use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) to flash the code onto your Arduino and try each component before writing full boat agorithem. 

The code uses Adafruit Motor Shield V1 Library, make sure you add this library to compile the code.

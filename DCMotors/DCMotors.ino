/* Example of using DC Motors with the driver shield.
 *  
 * A DC motor (Direct Current motor) is the most common type of motor. 
 * DC motors normally have just two leads, one positive and one negative. 
 * If you connect these two leads directly to a battery, the motor will rotate. 
 * If you switch the leads, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction.
 * Warning âˆ’ Do not drive the motor directly from Arduino board pins - This may damage the board. Use a driver Circuit or an IC.

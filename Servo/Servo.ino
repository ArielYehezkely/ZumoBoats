/* Example of using  with the driver shield.
 *  
 *  Servos have integrated gears and a shaft that can be precisely controlled. 
 *  Standard servos allow the shaft to be positioned at various angles, usually between 0 and 180 degrees. 
 *  Continuous rotation servos allow the rotation of the shaft to be set to various speeds.
